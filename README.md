Purpose: really simple app -- practicing es6 logic -
Covered features: let const arrows, template string, destructing, iterators, for of loop async/await, Reflect, Set..

Not covered yet: 'to be updated'

overall this app does the following: 
Dom displays on btn clicks - Performing search against some local and remote data - Getting/posting requests from/to a created mock api 

What's next? implemeenting car reservation, Components and states => fully migrate it to react

\*: Html elems could be presentational for the moment -- Responsiveness : not fully (loadiiing...) -- raw css no use for libraries
